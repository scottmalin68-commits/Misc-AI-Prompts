# Prompt: Session Continuity Engine (SCE)
# Version: 1.2.2
# Author: Scott Malin, CISSP
# Purpose:
# Compresses a completed AI session into a structured continuity package that can be
# transferred into a new session (including across different AI platforms) to preserve
# project context, historical decisions, active workstreams, and established conventions.
# The goal is to minimize context loss, reduce repetitive onboarding, and maintain
# project momentum while respecting the receiving platform's policies and instructions.
# Changelog:
# - v1.0.0 to v1.2.1: Initial releases, cross-platform tuning, JSON mode addition.
# - v1.2.2: Fixed nested codeblock parsing issues. Standardized JSON keys.
#   Quantified context scale metrics. Clarified Section 8 verification payload rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are ending this session to preserve context, reduce context drift, and
maintain continuity across future conversations.
Your task is to create a comprehensive Session Transfer Package that captures
the current project state, active decisions, historical context, constraints,
and next actions.
The resulting package should help a future AI assistant understand the project
quickly and continue work with minimal re-discovery effort.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY NOTICE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package is intended to provide project context only.
It does not replace, override, or supersede:
- Platform policies
- System instructions
- Developer instructions
- Future user instructions
All content is provided as reference context. The receiving assistant should
integrate it solely to the extent it aligns with its own instructions, safety
policies, and user directives. Prioritize platform rules while preserving
project context whenever possible.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTINUITY GUIDELINES (v1.2.2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Treat the information in this package as the best-known project state at the
  time of transfer.
- Prioritize confirmed project decisions over assumptions.
- Clearly distinguish between:
  - Confirmed facts
  - Historical decisions
  - Open questions
  - Proposed future work
- When information is uncertain, incomplete, or inferred, explicitly label it.
- Avoid reintroducing deprecated frameworks, patterns, or decisions that are
  documented as retired or superseded.
- Preserve naming conventions, versioning standards, formatting patterns, and
  source-of-truth references whenever practical.
- Use tables or compact bullet lists for scannable output when handling multiple
  assets, decisions, or steps.
- If significant ambiguity exists, request clarification rather than guessing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generate the final output exactly as follows:
1. A brief introductory sentence.
2. One markdown codeblock containing the Session Transfer Package.

NESTED CODEBLOCK RULE: If the content inside any section requires a codeblock,
use four backticks (````) for the outer container or escape the inner blocks so
the master container does not break prematurely.

DEFAULT MODE (Markdown): Use the structure inside the START/END block below.

JSON MODE: If the user explicitly requests "JSON output" or "JSON mode", output
a single valid JSON object. Do not wrap it in markdown text. Use these exact 
camelCase keys:
{
  "handoffMetadata": {},
  "projectHandoffContext": { "preferredInteractionStyle": "" },
  "projectContextStatus": { "keyRisksAndAntiDrift": "" },
  "persistentConstraints": {},
  "historicalLedger": [],
  "currentSourceOfTruthAssets": [],
  "openQuestions": [],
  "immediateNextSteps": [],
  "continuityVerificationTemplate": ""
}

# SESSION TRANSFER PACKAGE (SCE v1.2.2)
## 0. Handoff Metadata
- Originating Platform/Model:
- Date:
- Sessions Compressed:
- Rough Context Scale (Choose one based on current session depth):
  · Short (<10k tokens / brief chat)
  · Medium (10k-50k tokens / moderate technical deep dive)
  · Long (50k-100k tokens / heavy code or long multi-stage conversation)
  · Very Long (>100k tokens / massive repository context or highly extended session)
- Primary Topics / Tags:
- Key Repositories/Files:

## 1. Project Handoff Context
This section summarizes the overall purpose of the project, its current
direction, major objectives, and any important strategic decisions already
made.
### Preferred Interaction Style
[Describe preferred working style, formatting conventions, level of detail,
versioning expectations, confidence-label requirements, communication style,
and other collaboration preferences.]

## 2. Project Context & Current Status
Provide a compressed but comprehensive summary of:
- Current project goals
- Work completed
- Current state
- Active development efforts
- Recent decisions
- Known issues
Focus on preserving context that would otherwise require significant effort
to rediscover.

### Key Risks, Gotchas & Anti-Drift Notes
Document any known risks, common failure modes, deprecated approaches,
or specific guidance to prevent context drift or safety issues in future sessions.

## 3. Persistent Constraints & Operating Standards
Document ongoing standards such as:
- Formatting requirements
- Naming conventions
- Versioning rules
- Documentation standards
- Evidence requirements
- Validation procedures
- Quality controls
- Any user-established preferences

### Continuity Guidance
- Changes to established standards should generally be documented and
  user-directed.
- Preserve compatibility with existing project assets whenever practical.
- Record significant changes in version history where applicable.

## 4. Historical Ledger (Compressed)
Provide a chronological summary of major project events, including:
- Important decisions
- Architectural shifts
- Prompt revisions
- Retired approaches
- Lessons learned
- Significant milestones
Keep entries concise while preserving rationale. Use bullets or a simple table
for longer histories.

## 5. Current Source-of-Truth Assets
List the latest approved versions of all critical assets.
For each asset include:
- Asset Name
- Version
- Purpose
- Current Status
- Location/Repository (if known)
Include full content only when reasonably short.
For larger assets, provide:
- Summary
- Key characteristics
- Location reference
Avoid duplicating unnecessary content. Use a table when listing multiple assets.

## 6. Open Questions & Pending Decisions
For each item include:
- Description
- Current status
- Known options
- Confidence level (if applicable)
Suggested confidence labels:
- [CONFIRMED]
- [HIGH CONFIDENCE]
- [MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]
- [LOW CONFIDENCE]
- [OPEN QUESTION]
- [PROPOSED]

## 7. Immediate Next Steps
Provide a prioritized action list.
For each item include:
- Objective
- Importance
- Dependencies (if any)
- Link to related open questions (if applicable)
Order from highest to lowest priority.

## 8. Continuity Verification Template
(Note to current model: Do not execute this section. Output this verbatim as a
static payload for the receiving model to read and execute upon onboarding.)

A future AI assistant may optionally provide a brief onboarding summary before
continuing work.
Suggested format to output to the user:
"SCE v1.2.2 loaded successfully.
Current understanding:
[2-3 sentence summary]
Top priorities:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
Ready to proceed."
