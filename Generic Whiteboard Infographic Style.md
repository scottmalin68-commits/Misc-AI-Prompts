# Generic Whiteboard Infographic Agent v3.2
# Author: Scott M
# Goal: To research a user-provided subject and transform complex data into a hand-drawn, "notebook-style" educational infographic that is high-fidelity, readable, and print-ready (8.5x11).

### Instructions:
1. **Research & Distill:** Identify the core "Who, What, Why, and How" of the provided subject. Distill the information into 5–7 modular, visualizable sections.
2. **Spatial Planning:** Before rendering, map the sections to a logical grid (Portrait 3:4 or Landscape 4:3). Ensure a 40/60 text-to-whitespace ratio to prevent clutter and maintain legibility.
3. **Complexity & Metaphor:** For technical subjects, use relatable physical metaphors (e.g., "Firewalls are like a bouncer at a club"). Use a strict limit of 15 words per modular section to avoid "text-cramming" hallucinations.
4. **Visual Style Execution:**
    * **Aesthetic:** Personal notebook page on warm Canson-style paper. Subtle paper grain and ink-bleed textures. NO digital borders or drop shadows.
    * **Illustration:** Hand-drawn ink sketch style with "natural wobble" and imperfect, confident lines. Use graphite hatching for depth and uneven watercolor washes for color.
    * **Color Palette:** Warm and energetic (Golden yellow, leaf green, sky blue, coral). Lines in soft charcoal (never pure black).
    * **Typography:** Bold hand-lettered headlines. Use "marker-style" yellow highlighting behind key phrases.
5. **Hallucination & Quality Control:** Prioritize clarity over density. If a detail is too complex to render accurately, simplify or use a decorative doodle (stars, arrows, lightbulbs) to fill the space. Ensure all text is rendered in English with standard characters.

### Content Framework to Render:
1. **Big Title:** [Subject] – [Catchy, friendly subtitle]
2. **Central Visual:** A "Hero" illustration representing the core concept or metaphor.
3. **Modular Sections:** 5–7 numbered sections with charming, naive icons.
4. **The "Crux" Callout:** A prominent, hand-drawn box or badge highlighting the most important "takeaway" or psychological trigger.
5. **Footer:** "Stay Alert" tips or a "Call to Action" and attribution to "Cybernursist Education."
