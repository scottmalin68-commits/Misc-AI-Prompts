# Author: Scott M
# Supported AI Engines (sorted best to worst for hand-drawn sketch infographic aesthetic, 2026):
# 1. Midjourney — Best artistic warmth, imperfections, style coherence
# 2. Ideogram — Superior text rendering in banners/headlines/annotations
# 3. Leonardo.Ai — Excellent control, sketch-to-image, refinement tools
# 4. Flux (via Grok, Fal.ai, etc.) — Strong prompt fidelity, natural variations
# 5. DALL·E 3 / OpenAI GPT Image — Reliable literal interpretation, good text
# 6. Stable Diffusion (fine-tuned) — Maximum customization for exact hatching/imperfections
# 7. Grok built-in image gen — Fast & convenient for quick iterations

Create a hand-illustrated educational infographic in a warm, approachable sketchbook style about [BRIEF_TOPIC_DESCRIPTION e.g. "the basics of compound interest", "how photosynthesis works", "Pomodoro technique", "pros and cons of remote work"].

Overall aesthetic: Feels like a friendly expert's personal notebook page — hand-crafted, human, slightly imperfect, never sterile/digital/perfect/vector. Off-white to warm cream background with subtle paper grain texture. Content extends fully to edges — NO border, NO frame, NO edge decoration, NO photo-like drop shadow around the whole image. It IS the notebook page itself.

Illustration style: Hand-drawn ink sketch aesthetic. Medium-weight strokes for main elements, thinner for details. Confident but imperfect lines with natural wobble, slight overlaps, pressure variation. Loose hatching and gentle cross-hatching for shadows/texture. Never solid fills — use watercolor-like transparent washes that are slightly uneven/streaky. Simple, charming, slightly naive icons and objects reduced to essential forms. Casual isometric or flat perspective. Friendly human figures with minimal features (dot eyes, basic expressions), clear communicative gestures, varied silhouettes.

Color palette: Warm, optimistic, energetic yet calm. Medium saturation. Primary: warm golden yellow / soft mustard (highlights, energy, key callouts), fresh leaf green / soft teal (growth, success, positive outcomes), calm sky blue / soft navy (trust, stability, clarity), warm coral / soft peach (warmth, friendly emphasis, action items). Neutrals: warm grays, soft browns, cream/off-white paper tones. Lines in soft charcoal (never pure black). Strategic color pops for hierarchy; colors may slightly bleed past lines for hand-colored feel. Soft rounded color-block backgrounds to separate sections.

Typography: Bold hand-lettered headlines (slightly uneven baseline, often uppercase, heavy weight, charcoal or accent color). Medium-weight subheadings with optional underlines/banners/highlight boxes. Clean, warm, readable body text (generous spacing, sans-serif with subtle handwriting personality). Casual handwritten annotations/notes with arrows for explanations/emphasis.

Layout: Modular grid with organic flexibility. Clear numbered/lettered sections (circled numbers, badges, playful tags). Generous white space/breathing room. Natural left-to-right, top-to-bottom flow guided by visual hierarchy. Hand-drawn curved arrows, dotted connectors, curly braces for grouping related ideas. Before/after, step sequences, transformation arrows where appropriate. Soft rounded rectangles, hand-drawn boxes, or gentle color blocks for section separation.

Hierarchy & emphasis: Large bold headers + bright accents + main illustrations as primary focus. Subheadings, key icons, section backgrounds as secondary. Body text/details/annotations as tertiary. Use yellow marker-style highlighting behind key words/phrases, size contrast, boxing in rounded shapes/badges, small icons (stars, checkmarks, exclamation points) for emphasis.

Decorative touches: Ribbon banners, circular badges, tag shapes for labels/key terms. Tiny relevant doodles, stars/sparkles filling awkward spaces. Subtle paper grain throughout.

Content to include:
[CONTENT_OUTLINE_HERE e.g.
1. Big title: Compound Interest – The Magic of Earning on Earnings
2. Central visual: Growing money tree or compound curve graph with years on x-axis and money on y-axis, arrows showing growth
3. Key formula box: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) with short plain-English explanation
4. 3–4 numbered benefit sections with icons (e.g., exponential growth, beats inflation, long-term wealth)
5. Real-world example callout: "$10,000 invested at 7% over 30 years becomes ≈ $76,123"
6. Motivational sidebar: "Start early! Time is the real superpower"
7. Small repeating icons: coins, upward arrows, tiny trees/plants]

Authenticity: Natural line variation, slight color bleeds, intentionally imperfect alignment, occasional overlaps/reworks. Feels like one person's genuine visual thinking process — spontaneous, confident, warm.

High resolution, clear and readable text at all sizes, balanced composition, suitable for print and digital sharing. --ar 3:4 --stylize 250 --q 2 --v 6 (adjust parameters based on engine: e.g., for Midjourney use --stylize 200-350; for Ideogram emphasize text placement)

Negative prompt / strictly avoid: border, frame, wooden/whiteboard frame effect, photograph of a poster, realistic photo style, drop shadow around entire image, sterile vector perfection, uniform crisp lines, perfect mechanical alignment, cold pure whites or harsh blacks, neon/garish/clashing colors, corporate clip-art, stiff lifeless figures, overwhelming text density without visual relief, rigid grid, symmetrical perfection that kills warmth and humanity.
