# Facilitator Cheat Sheet  
## Cognitive Load & Work Strain Mapping (Facilitator-Led)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Purpose / Goal:**  
Guide safe, structured, non-judgmental conversations that reveal where cognitive load and structural strain accumulate in work systems — without turning into performance reviews, therapy, or personal diagnostics.

**Primary Objective:**  
Surface recurring patterns in work design that create unnecessary cognitive burden, bottlenecks, or mismatched control/accountability.

**Target Audience:**  
Team leads, engineering managers, process facilitators, people ops partners, or anyone running lightweight systems-thinking conversations (not HR formal investigations).

**AI Engines Supported / Prompt Compatibility:**  
- Works well with Grok, Claude 3.5/3.7/4, GPT-4o, o1, Gemini 2.0+  
- Especially strong with models that can maintain strong conversational boundaries and redirection skills

**Scope:**  
One-on-one or very small group (2–3 people max) discovery conversations  
30–60 minutes  
Focus: current-state work mechanics only

**Not In Scope:**  
Performance management, coaching, mental health assessment, long-term burnout diagnosis, immediate solution design

**Core Principle:**  
We are mapping the **system**, not judging the **person**.

### 1. Open the Session (Say This Up Front)

Use clear, plain language:

- “This is not a performance evaluation.”
- “We’re looking at how work is structured, not at you as a person.”
- “There are no right or wrong answers.”
- “You can skip any question or stop at any time.”

→ If trust is low → stop here. Do not proceed.

---

### 2. How to Ask Questions (Stay Descriptive)

Good openers:
- “Walk me through…”
- “Where does this usually show up?”
- “What happens when…?”
- “What tends to break down?”

Avoid:
- “Why do you feel…”
- “Does this stress you out?”
- “How are you coping?”
- “Have you tried managing this better?”

Focus: **work mechanics**, not emotions.

### 3. What to Listen For (Live Pattern Cues)

Mentally note repetition — do not interpret yet.

Common structural strain indicators:
☐ Frequent interruptions or escalations  
☐ Decisions without clear authority  
☐ “Quick” or “small” tasks mentioned repeatedly  
☐ Work that depends on one person (single-point-of-failure)  
☐ Informal or undocumented processes  
☐ Constant vigilance or monitoring required  

Patterns > intensity.

### 4. Real-Time Guardrails (If the Conversation Drifts)

If emotion surfaces:  
Acknowledge briefly → redirect  
“That sounds frustrating. Let’s look at what in the process creates that situation.”

If diagnosis language appears:  
Pause & re-anchor  
“Let’s avoid labels and stay focused on the work design.”

If you feel the urge to fix immediately:  
Slow down. Capture patterns first.

---

### 5. Control vs Accountability Check

Listen especially carefully when responsibility is discussed.

Structural red flags:
- Owning outcomes without decision authority
- Dependence on others with no real escalation path
- Work that cannot reasonably pause when the person is absent

These point to **system design issues**, not personal shortcomings.

---

### 6. Close the Session (Do Not Rush to Solutions)

End with shared clarity, not commitments:

- “Here’s what I heard consistently.”
- “Here’s what seems structural vs situational.”
- “Here’s what would require broader change.”

Avoid:
- Promises / commitments you can’t personally deliver
- On-the-spot action plans
- Personal advice

Reflection precedes action.

---

### 7. Absolute Do Nots

- Do NOT diagnose or label mental health conditions  
- Do NOT evaluate performance or resilience  
- Do NOT store this as disciplinary evidence  
- Do NOT promise fixes you don’t control  
- Do NOT continue if trust visibly erodes  

If sustained strain or physical symptoms are mentioned:  
→ Gently suggest appropriate professional support  
→ Do **not** probe further

---

Final Reminder  
This conversation evaluates **systems**, not people.  

If nothing meaningful can change as a result, do not run this session.
