# Facilitator Pre-Session Checklist  
## Cognitive Load & Work Strain Mapping

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Purpose / Goal:**  
Provide a mandatory pre-session gatekeeping process to determine whether it is safe, ethical, and responsible to run the Cognitive Load & Work Strain Mapping conversation at all.

**Primary Objective:**  
Protect participants from harm, protect facilitators from ethical compromise, and preserve the integrity of the systems-mapping practice by stopping sessions that fail any critical condition.

**Target Audience:**  
Team leads, engineering managers, process facilitators, people ops partners — anyone intending to schedule or run the work-design mapping conversation.

**AI Engines Supported / Prompt Compatibility:**  
- Grok, Claude 3.5/3.7/4, GPT-4o, o1, Gemini 2.0+  
- Useful with models that can help simulate/facilitate honest self-assessment and boundary checking

**Scope:**  
Pre-scheduling self-audit checklist (must be completed before any session is booked)  
All sections marked "Required" are non-negotiable gates.

**Not In Scope:**  
Post-session review, in-session facilitation tactics, or performance/HR processes

**Core Principle:**  
If the conditions for safety, trust, good faith, and meaningful follow-through are not clearly met, **the responsible choice is always to not run the conversation**.

---

### Section 1: Intent Check (Required)

Answer honestly — no hedging.

- ☐ My goal is genuinely to understand **work structure**, not to evaluate the person  
- ☐ I am truly open to findings that contradict my current assumptions  
- ☐ I am not using this conversation to explain or justify a performance concern  
- ☐ I am not seeking confirmation for a decision I’ve already made  

→ Any unchecked box → **STOP**. Do not schedule.

---

### Section 2: Timing Check (Required)

Confirm the current organizational and personal context.

- ☐ No active performance review or disciplinary process exists  
- ☐ No layoffs, role eliminations, or restructures are imminent  
- ☐ This conversation will not be used (or perceived) as documentation or evidence  
- ☐ The participant is not currently in the middle of a recent major crisis or incident  

→ Any unchecked box → **STOP**. Do not proceed.

---

### Section 3: Trust & Power Check (Required)

Assess the relationship dynamics realistically.

- ☐ Trust between me and the participant is sufficient for open candor  
- ☐ Participation is clearly voluntary (never implied or coerced)  
- ☐ My role/authority does not make honest answers feel risky to the participant  
- ☐ If trust is limited, a credible neutral facilitator is available and willing  

→ Any unchecked box → **PAUSE** and either rebuild trust or reassign to a neutral party.

---

### Section 4: Capacity to Act Check (Required)

Confirm realistic follow-through potential.

- ☐ I have authority to change at least some of the structural issues that may surface  
- ☐ There is a clear path to escalate issues I personally cannot fix  
- ☐ The organization is realistically willing to hear and consider uncomfortable insights  
- ☐ I am prepared to do nothing (and communicate that) if no safe action exists  

→ Any unchecked box → **DO NOT PROCEED**. Running without follow-through creates harm.

---

### Section 5: Scope & Safety Check (Required)

Confirm personal commitment to strict boundaries.

- ☐ I will not diagnose, label, or interpret mental health in any way  
- ☐ I will not evaluate resilience, attitude, or personal coping strategies  
- ☐ I will redirect any emotional content back to work structure immediately  
- ☐ I will stop the session immediately if it exceeds scope or becomes unsafe  

→ Any unchecked box → **STOP**. Revisit your own readiness.

---

### Section 6: Participant Readiness Check (Recommended)

Confirm the participant has clear context and real consent.

- ☐ The participant understands this is **not** a performance review  
- ☐ The participant knows they can skip any question or stop at any time  
- ☐ Expectations, purpose, and limits have been explained in advance  

→ If unclear → **CLARIFY** before proceeding.

---

### Final Gate Question (Mandatory)

Ask yourself seriously:

> “If nothing can change as a result of this conversation, would it still be responsible to run it?”

- ☐ Yes  
- ☐ No  

→ If “No” → **DO NOT RUN THIS SESSION**.

---

Final Reminder  
This checklist exists to protect three things:  
- The participant’s psychological safety  
- The facilitator’s ethical integrity  
- The long-term credibility of this practice  

Skipping or rushing this checklist is itself a strong signal to stop.  
Not running the conversation is often the most responsible action you can take.
