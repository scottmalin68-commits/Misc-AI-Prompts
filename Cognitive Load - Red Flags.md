# Red Flags: When NOT to Run This Conversation  
## Companion to Cognitive Load & Work Strain Mapping

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Purpose / Goal:**  
Protect participants, facilitators, and organizational trust by clearly identifying situations where running the Cognitive Load & Work Strain Mapping conversation would be unsafe, unethical, or counterproductive.

**Primary Objective:**  
Prevent misuse of the tool, avoid harm (including moral injury to participants and facilitators), and stop sessions that cannot produce meaningful, non-harmful insight.

**Target Audience:**  
Same as the main mapping guide: team leads, engineering managers, process facilitators, people ops partners, or anyone considering running the work-design conversation.

**AI Engines Supported / Prompt Compatibility:**  
- Grok, Claude 3.5/3.7/4, GPT-4o, o1, Gemini 2.0+  
- Especially useful with models that excel at boundary maintenance and ethical redirection

**Scope:**  
Pre-session screening checklist + in-session stop conditions  
Applies before scheduling and during the conversation itself

**Not In Scope:**  
Excusing poor management practices, justifying inaction, or overriding legitimate HR/performance processes

**Core Principle:**  
If the conditions for psychological safety, good faith, and meaningful follow-through are not met, **not running the conversation is the correct and responsible decision**.

### 1. Timing Red Flags (Hard Stops)

Do NOT run this conversation if any of the following are true:

- ⛔ A performance issue is currently under formal review
- ⛔ Disciplinary action is underway or anticipated
- ⛔ Layoffs, role eliminations, or restructures are imminent
- ⛔ The participant recently experienced a major incident or personal crisis
- ⛔ The conversation could reasonably be perceived as evidence gathering

→ If the participant cannot speak freely without fear of consequences, the session is unsafe.

---

### 2. Intent Red Flags (Most Dangerous)

Do NOT proceed if the underlying goal (conscious or unconscious) is to:

- ⛔ “Figure out what’s wrong with them”
- ⛔ Assess whether they can handle the role
- ⛔ Validate or justify a decision already made
- ⛔ Encourage admission of overload/failure for organizational convenience
- ⛔ Reduce organizational risk at the participant’s expense

This tool is for understanding work systems — never for confirmation bias or justification.

---

### 3. Relationship & Trust Red Flags

Do NOT run if:

- ⛔ Trust between facilitator and participant is low
- ⛔ There is unresolved conflict between the two
- ⛔ The facilitator controls pay, promotion, or job security *and* trust is weak
- ⛔ Participation feels mandatory rather than truly voluntary

→ Low trust = distorted or withheld information. Skip the session.

---

### 4. Capacity & Follow-Through Red Flags

Do NOT proceed if:

- ⛔ No meaningful changes are realistically possible
- ⛔ The facilitator lacks authority (or escalation path) to act on findings
- ⛔ The organization is structurally unwilling to hear inconvenient truths

Running without follow-through capacity creates cynicism and moral injury.

---

### 5. Scope & Misuse Red Flags

Do NOT use this conversation as a substitute for:

- ⛔ Performance management processes
- ⛔ Wellness checks or mental health screening
- ⛔ Documenting “resilience concerns”
- ⛔ Evaluating emotional response, attitude, or coping
- ⛔ Collecting data for HR, legal, or compliance purposes

This is strictly a work-design systems conversation.

---

### 6. In-Session Stop Conditions

Immediately pause or end the session if the participant:

- Expresses ongoing physical symptoms (e.g., chronic pain, severe fatigue)
- Indicates inability to function day-to-day
- Shows distress that goes well beyond work structure
- Requests help outside the scope of work design

Response guidance:
- Acknowledge the concern calmly and respectfully
- Suggest seeking appropriate professional support
- Do **not** probe, analyze, or continue the mapping exercise

---

### 7. Facilitator Self-Check (Before Scheduling)

If you answer “yes” to **any** of these, do not proceed:

- “Would I still run this if the findings completely contradicted my current assumptions?”
- “Could anything surfaced here be used against the participant later?”
- “Am I secretly hoping this explains or justifies a performance problem?”
- “Do I lack real ability to influence or escalate what might surface?”

→ Yes = pause and reconsider.

---

Final Reminder  
This conversation requires four non-negotiables:  
- Trust  
- Psychological safety  
- Good faith intent  
- Realistic capacity to act  

If even one is missing, **do not run it**.  

Not running the conversation is frequently the most ethical and protective choice you can make.
